# <Challenge-2-Portfolio>

## Description

For this project I made a portfolio from scratch. I put in the title, navagation bar, about me, work, and contact me form. I divided all of them up into sections. I also made sure that the navigation bar took you to each of the sections. I then made the words about me, work, and contact me on the left side and the sections on the right hand side. I have learned how to make things to side by side, divide each section up and making sure each navigation link goes to the correct section.
